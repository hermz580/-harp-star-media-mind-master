## 1. Project Overview

**Harp * Star Media Mind Master** is a premium, full-stack intelligence platform designed to recursively scan your entire system, learn the DNA of your brand, and manifest coordinated content across all your digital platforms (WordPress, Instagram, YouTube, and custom integrations). It turns raw assets dumped into a "Bucket" into strategic, agent-led workflows with zero manual friction.

---

## 2. Design Philosophy & Rationale

Built for power users and community leaders who demand absolute control over their narrative.

- **Obsidian & Plasma Aesthetics**: A high-fidelity, futuristic interface that reflects the seriousness of the mission.
- **Sovereignty First**: Designed to run locally, ensuring your data never leaves your control until you "Ignite" a post.
- **Agentic Harmony**: Multiple AI agents working in a pipeline rather than isolated chat boxes.

---

## 3. System Architecture & Data Flow

1. **Multi-Root Ingestion**: The system deep-scans designated folders (Roots) to build a "V-Brain" context map.
2. **The Bucket**: Users drop raw media/docs into the Nexus.
3. **Neural Synthesis**: The Orchestrator matches the assets against the V-Brain and the Global Mission Focus.
4. **Execution Pipeline**: Workflows are manifested, approved by the user, and ignited across connected platforms via Agentic scripts.

## 4. Component Analysis

### `brand-engine/main.py`

- **Purpose**: FastAPI backend; acts as the primary API bridge.
- **Status**: Production-ready.
- **Inputs**: HTTP requests, file uploads.
- **Outputs**: JSON state, manifested content URLs.

### `brand-engine/brand_brain/orchestrator.py`

- **Purpose**: The "Master Mind." Handles machine learning (V-Brain), asset orchestration, and platform connections.
- **Dependencies**: Gemini 1.5 Pro, local filesystem.

### `brand-engine/public/index.html`

- **Purpose**: Premium Command Center UI.
- **Security**: Features the **Harp*Star Lockdown Protocol**—the system self-terminates if branding is tampered with.

---

## 5. Data Schema Guide

- **V-Brain (`vbrain.json`)**: Persistent JSON store for learned patterns, context maps, and agent integrations.
- **Workflows**: Ephemeral objects tracking ID, Asset, Story, Agent Tasks, and Platform Status.

## 6. Project Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Python 3.11+.
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn google-generativeai python-dotenv
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with your `GEMINI_API_KEY` and platform credentials.

---

## 7. How to Run the Platform

```bash
python main.py
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## 8. Proposed Conventions & Best Practices

- **Atomic Drops**: Process one campaign per bucket drop for maximum fidelity.
- **Focus Locking**: Always update your "Global Intelligence Focus" bar before a sync session.
- **Root Discipline**: Only ingest trusted codebase/document roots to maintain V-Brain purity.

---

## 9. Action Plan & Next Steps

- [ ] **Phase 3**: Real-time video generation integration via FAL.AI or Replicate.
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Deep-Search integration for live web-intel scraping.
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Mobile Companion App for remote "Ignite" approvals.
